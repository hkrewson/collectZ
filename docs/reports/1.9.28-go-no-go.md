# 1.9.28 Pre-2.0 Go/No-Go Report

Date: 2026-02-24
Version under validation: 1.9.28

## Evidence sources
- Migration rehearsal evidence: `docs/reports/1.9.28-migration-rehearsal-evidence.json`
- Backend unit test run: `docker compose exec -T backend npm run test:unit`
- Backend API integration smoke: `docker compose exec -T backend npm run test:integration-smoke`
- Runtime version check: `docker compose exec -T backend node -e "console.log(process.env.APP_VERSION)"`

## Gate matrix
- Migration rehearsal (upgrade + rollback): PASS
- Rollback integrity counts match baseline: PASS
- Rollback version equals baseline: PASS
- Backend unit tests: PASS
- API integration smoke tests: PASS
- Runtime version aligned to milestone: PASS (`APP_VERSION=1.9.28`)
- High vulnerability remediation complete: FAIL (tracked but not fully remediated)

## Migration rehearsal summary
- Baseline version: 14
- Latest version: 15
- Pre-upgrade counts: users=1, media=1, invites=1, app_integrations=1, feature_flags=5
- Post-upgrade counts: users=1, media=1, invites=1, app_integrations=1, feature_flags=5
- Rollback counts: users=1, media=1, invites=1, app_integrations=1, feature_flags=5

## Decision
NO-GO for 2.0 at this moment.

Reason:
- Migration safety gates passed, but pre-2.0 security closure is still incomplete due unresolved `high` dependency findings targeted in the 1.9.28 triage/remediation scope.

## Required actions before 2.0 go
1. Complete dependency/base-image remediation pass and reduce/justify remaining high findings.
2. Re-run CI dependency and image scans and attach final evidence artifacts.
3. Update this report decision to GO once security gate is closed.
