# 2.0.0-rc.1 Go/No-Go Report

Date: 2026-03-02  
Owner: collectZ engineering  
Version under test: `2.0.0-rc.1`  
Decision: `GO`

## Scope

RC validation for:
- multi-user auth/RBAC stability,
- mixed media CRUD/import coverage,
- migration and rollback confidence,
- CI security and release gate readiness.

## Evidence Checklist

### Required CI Gates

- [x] Secret scan
- [x] Dependency scan
- [x] Migration check (init parity + rehearsal)
- [x] Compose smoke
- [x] RBAC regression check
- [x] Image security scan + SBOM

### Required Test Artifacts

- [x] `docs/testing/2.0.0-rc.1-test-matrix.md` completed
- [x] migration rehearsal evidence attached
- [x] init parity evidence attached
- [x] security scan summaries attached

### Runtime/Manual Validation

- [x] Public test-server rehearsal complete
- [x] Blocker incidents from tester reports resolved
- [x] Media-type matrix complete (movie/tv/book/audio/game)
- [x] Import quality checks complete (Plex/CSV/Delicious/comics where enabled)

## Baseline Automated Results (Current Session)

- `test:unit`: PASS (13 tests).
- `test:integration-smoke`: PASS.
- `test:init-parity`: PASS (executed in one-off mounted container using explicit `INIT_SQL_PATH`).
- `test:migration-rehearsal`: PASS (evidence written to `backend/artifacts/migration-rehearsal-evidence.json`).
- `test:rbac-regression`: PASS (with explicit credentialed env profile).
- `test:cross-type-isolation`: PASS (with explicit `RBAC_ADMIN_EMAIL` + `RBAC_ADMIN_PASSWORD`).

## Blockers

- None open for RC.1 sign-off.

## Known Non-Blockers / Follow-ups

- Script ergonomics incidental:
  - `test:init-parity` requires explicit `INIT_SQL_PATH` when executed from backend-only container image.
  - `test:rbac-regression` defaults to `http://localhost:3000`; in containerized execution this should be overridden with `BASE_URL`.

## Final Decision

- `GO` or `NO-GO`: GO
- Reason: RC.1 gates and matrix criteria have been validated for release-candidate deployment.
