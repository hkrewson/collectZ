# 2.0.0-rc.1 Go/No-Go Report

Date: 2026-03-01  
Owner: collectZ engineering  
Version under test: `2.0.0-beta.6` (RC.1 validation in progress)  
Decision: `PENDING`

## Scope

RC validation for:
- multi-user auth/RBAC stability,
- mixed media CRUD/import coverage,
- migration and rollback confidence,
- CI security and release gate readiness.

## Evidence Checklist

### Required CI Gates

- [ ] Secret scan
- [ ] Dependency scan
- [x] Migration check (init parity + rehearsal)
- [ ] Compose smoke
- [ ] RBAC regression check
- [ ] Image security scan + SBOM

### Required Test Artifacts

- [ ] `docs/testing/2.0.0-rc.1-test-matrix.md` completed
- [x] migration rehearsal evidence attached
- [x] init parity evidence attached
- [ ] security scan summaries attached

### Runtime/Manual Validation

- [ ] Public test-server rehearsal complete
- [ ] Blocker incidents from tester reports resolved
- [ ] Media-type matrix complete (movie/tv/book/audio/game)
- [ ] Import quality checks complete (Plex/CSV/Delicious/comics where enabled)

## Baseline Automated Results (Current Session)

- `test:unit`: PASS (13 tests).
- `test:integration-smoke`: PASS.
- `test:init-parity`: PASS (executed in one-off mounted container using explicit `INIT_SQL_PATH`).
- `test:migration-rehearsal`: PASS (evidence written to `backend/artifacts/migration-rehearsal-evidence.json`).
- `test:rbac-regression`: BLOCKED (default script URL and/or credential context issue; requires explicit RC command profile).
- `test:cross-type-isolation`: BLOCKED until `RBAC_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `RBAC_ADMIN_PASSWORD` are provided for non-empty DB.

## Blockers

- RC automation blocker: credentialed RBAC and cross-type checks need standardized runner env for non-empty databases.

## Known Non-Blockers / Follow-ups

- Script ergonomics incidental:
  - `test:init-parity` requires explicit `INIT_SQL_PATH` when executed from backend-only container image.
  - `test:rbac-regression` defaults to `http://localhost:3000`; in containerized execution this should be overridden with `BASE_URL`.

## Final Decision

- `GO` or `NO-GO`: TBD
- Reason: TBD
