# 1.9.6 Smoke Checklist

## Auth + Role UX

1. Open `/dashboard` with no session.
2. Confirm loading state appears briefly, then login page appears.
3. Log in as a non-admin user.
4. Confirm admin nav group is not shown.
5. Manually navigate to an admin tab URL/state and confirm an "Access Restricted" view appears.

## Activity Filters

1. Log in as admin and open `Admin Settings -> Activity`.
2. Filter by `action` and click `Apply`; confirm rows narrow.
3. Filter by `entity` (`media`, `user`, `invite`) and click `Apply`; confirm rows narrow.
4. Filter by `user` using email substring and click `Apply`; confirm rows show matching user.
5. Filter by `from` + `to` and click `Apply`; confirm date range behavior.
6. Confirm rendered rows show user email when available.

## Import Menu (Barcode)

1. Open `Library -> Import`.
2. Confirm tabs include `Barcode`, `Generic CSV`, `Delicious CSV` (and `Plex` for admin).
3. Select `Barcode`, enter a UPC, and run lookup.
4. Confirm matches render with `Add` buttons.
5. Add one match and verify:
   - success toast appears,
   - library refreshes with the added item,
   - no UI errors are shown.

## Regression

1. Run a quick Plex async import start from Import tab.
2. Run a Generic CSV import start from Import tab.
3. Confirm both still queue and show status updates.
