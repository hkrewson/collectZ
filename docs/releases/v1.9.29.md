# v1.9.29

## Version and date
- Version: `1.9.29`
- Date: `2026-02-24`

## Milestone target and status
- Milestone: `1.9.29 — Pre-2.0 Security Remediation Closure`
- Status: `Completed`

## Summary
This release closes the remaining pre-2.0 high-vulnerability remediation gate and updates preflight readiness to allow 2.0 planning to proceed.

## What changed
### Frontend
- Moved `react-scripts` from runtime dependencies to `devDependencies` so production dependency scan reflects actual runtime footprint.

### Backend
- Upgraded `bcrypt` from `^5.1.1` to `^6.0.0` to remove transitive high-severity advisories (`node-pre-gyp`/`tar`/`glob` chain).
- Upgraded `multer` from `^1.4.5-lts.1` to `^2.0.2`.

### Database
- No schema changes.

### Docs/Ops
- Added final go/no-go report for post-remediation state:
  - `docs/reports/1.9.29-go-no-go.md`
- Added security audit evidence artifact:
  - `docs/reports/1.9.29-security-audit-summary.json`

## Breaking changes
- None expected for API behavior in this release.

## Environment/config changes
- None.

## Migration and data impact
- None.

## Deployment and verification
1. Rebuild and restart stack:
   - `docker compose --env-file .env up -d --build --force-recreate`
2. Verify version:
   - `docker compose --env-file .env exec -T backend node -e "console.log(process.env.APP_VERSION)"`
3. Verify backend tests:
   - `docker compose --env-file .env exec -T backend npm run test:unit`
   - `docker compose --env-file .env exec -T backend npm run test:integration-smoke`
4. Verify security scans:
   - backend production audit reports `high=0`, `critical=0`
   - frontend production audit reports `high=0`, `critical=0`

## Rollback guidance
- Roll back to `1.9.28` image tag if regression is found.
- No schema rollback required.

## Known issues and follow-up
- Continue routine dependency hygiene in normal release cadence.

## Security vulnerability triage
- High findings: remediated for current production dependency trees.
- Owner: `@hkrewson`
- Target remediation milestone: `1.9.29`
- Exception/compensating control: none required after remediation evidence.
