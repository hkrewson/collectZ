# v2.0.0-alpha.8

- Date: 2026-02-25
- Version: `2.0.0-alpha.8`
- Scope: admin library guardrails UX and active-library clarity

## Changed

- Strengthened admin library actions in Members → Libraries:
  - Transfer now requires explicit `TRANSFER` confirmation.
  - Archive now requires `ARCHIVE <LibraryName>` phrase.
  - Delete now requires `DELETE <LibraryName>` phrase.
  - Added guardrail copy explaining transfer/archive/delete impact.
- Improved active-library visibility:
  - Library view header now always shows an explicit active library badge.
  - Import view now shows a target library banner with “active library only” behavior note.
  - Admin users now see disambiguated owner context in active-library labels where available.
- Import actions are disabled when no active library is selected.
