# v1.9.28

## Version and date
- Version: `1.9.28`
- Date: `2026-02-24`

## Milestone target and status
- Milestone: `1.9.28 — Final 2.0 Migration Readiness Rehearsal`
- Status: `Completed`

## Summary
This release completes the final pre-2.0 migration readiness rehearsal package by generating production-like upgrade/rollback evidence and publishing an explicit go/no-go report artifact.

## What changed
### Frontend
- No user-facing feature changes in this milestone.

### Backend
- Added integration-level API smoke test script:
  - `backend/scripts/api-integration-smoke.js`
- Added backend unit-test runner script:
  - `backend/scripts/unit-tests.js`
- Added npm scripts:
  - `test:unit`
  - `test:integration-smoke`

### Database
- No production schema changes in this milestone.
- Rehearsal verifies migration/rollback behavior against generated production-like fixture clone databases.

### Docs/Ops
- Added final rehearsal outputs under:
  - `docs/reports/1.9.28-migration-rehearsal-evidence.json`
  - `docs/reports/1.9.28-go-no-go.md`
- Updated roadmap and release policy alignment for pre-2.0 signoff.

## Breaking changes
- None.

## Environment/config changes
- None required for normal runtime.
- Rehearsal command requires DB admin-level connection context in the test environment.

## Migration and data impact
- No production migrations are applied by this release itself.
- Rehearsal verifies upgrade to latest migration and rollback to baseline on isolated rehearsal DBs.

## Deployment and verification
1. Build and start stack:
   - `docker compose --env-file .env up -d --build`
2. Confirm backend/frontend health.
3. Run backend unit tests:
   - `docker compose --env-file .env exec -T backend npm run test:unit`
4. Run backend API integration smoke:
   - `docker compose --env-file .env exec -T backend npm run test:integration-smoke`
5. Run migration rehearsal and capture evidence:
   - `docker compose --env-file .env exec -T backend sh -lc 'DATABASE_URL="postgresql://$DB_USER:$DB_PASSWORD@db:5432/$POSTGRES_DB" MIGRATION_REHEARSAL_ADMIN_URL="postgresql://$DB_USER:$DB_PASSWORD@db:5432/postgres" MIGRATION_REHEARSAL_OUTPUT=artifacts/migration-rehearsal-evidence.json npm run test:migration-rehearsal && cat artifacts/migration-rehearsal-evidence.json' > docs/reports/1.9.28-migration-rehearsal-evidence.json`

## Rollback guidance
- Roll back deployment to previous version tag (for example `1.9.27`) if non-migration regressions are observed.
- No production schema rollback is required by this release.
- For 2.0 planning, use the rehearsal rollback evidence in `docs/reports/1.9.28-go-no-go.md`.

## Known issues and follow-up
- Remaining dependency `high` findings require remediation execution prior to final 2.0 release cut.
- UI refinement sprint is scheduled post-2.0 (`2.5.0`).

## Security vulnerability triage
- High findings: present in dependency scan outputs; triaged and tracked.
- Owner: `@hkrewson`
- Target remediation milestone: `1.9.29`
- Exception/compensating control: CI blocks critical findings and enforces high-finding triage documentation.
