# v2.0.0-alpha.6.3

- Date: 2026-02-24
- Version: `2.0.0-alpha.6.3`
- Scope: library selection scope-hint policy fix

## Fixed

- `POST /api/libraries/select` for non-admin users no longer fails with:
  - `403 Scope access denied (hints_not_allowed_for_role)`
- Libraries router now permits scope hints for authenticated roles while still enforcing membership checks.
