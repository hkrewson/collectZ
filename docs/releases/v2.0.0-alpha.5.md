# v2.0.0-alpha.5

- Date: 2026-02-24
- Version: `2.0.0-alpha.5`
- Scope: active library persistence correctness

## Fixed

- Corrected default-library helper behavior that unintentionally overwrote user-selected active library.
- `ensureUserDefaultLibrary` now only assigns a default when active library is missing/invalid.
- Library switching now remains stable across `/api/libraries` refresh and subsequent page requests.

## Validation Focus

1. Create a new library and verify it becomes active and stays active.
2. Switch across multiple libraries and verify badge + media contents update accordingly.
3. Refresh the page and verify active library remains selected.
