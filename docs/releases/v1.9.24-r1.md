# v1.9.24-r1

## Version and date
- Version: `1.9.24-r1`
- Date: `2026-02-24`

## Milestone target and status
- Target: 1.9.24 observability triage with UI simplification patch
- Status: Completed

## Summary
Kept backend activity triage improvements (`status`/`reason` filtering) while simplifying Activity UI back to a single-search workflow with minimal controls.

## What changed
### Frontend
- Simplified `Admin Settings -> Activity` controls to:
  - single `Search` field,
  - `Page size` selector,
  - paging row below.
- Removed UI controls from default view:
  - `Apply`,
  - `Clear`,
  - `Refresh`,
  - always-visible multi-field filter grid.
- Retained status/reason badges on activity rows for quick scan.

### Backend
- `/api/admin/activity` supports triage filters:
  - `status` (for example `4xx`, `5xx`, `401`),
  - `reason` (substring on `details.reason`).
- Search includes `details.status` and `details.reason`.
- Activity response includes:
  - `details_status`,
  - `details_reason`.

### Database
- No schema changes.

### Docs/Ops
- Added runbook:
  - `docs/wiki/16-Activity-Triage-Runbook.md`
- Added policy guidance:
  - `docs/wiki/14-Engineering-Delivery-Policy.md`
  - new `UI Simplicity Default Policy`.

## Breaking changes
- None.

## Environment/config changes
- No environment variable changes.

## Migration and data impact
- No migrations required.
- No data changes.

## Deployment and verification
1. Rebuild stack:
   - `docker compose --env-file .env up -d --build`
2. Verify version:
   - `/api/health` returns `1.9.24-r1`
3. In `Admin Settings -> Activity`:
   - confirm single search field + page size on top row,
   - confirm no apply/clear/refresh buttons,
   - confirm paging row remains below.
4. Search and confirm results narrow (press Enter).

## Rollback guidance
- Revert frontend activity view and version bump if UI behavior regresses.
- No DB rollback required.

## Known issues and follow-up
- Advanced filtering remains available at API level and can be reintroduced behind an explicit advanced toggle later if needed.
