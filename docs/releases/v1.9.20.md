# v1.9.20

## Version and date
- Version: `1.9.20`
- Date: `2026-02-24`

## Milestone target and status
- Target: 1.9.20 frontend modularity / App.js de-bloat execution
- Status: Completed

## Summary
Reduced monolithic frontend app-shell complexity by extracting high-churn admin/profile feature panels into dedicated component modules while preserving behavior.

## What changed
### Frontend
- Added new component modules:
  - `frontend/src/components/ProfileView.js`
  - `frontend/src/components/AdminUsersView.js`
  - `frontend/src/components/AdminSettingsView.js`
  - `frontend/src/components/AdminIntegrationsView.js`
- Refactored `frontend/src/App.js` to delegate these screens to module wrappers.
- Removed in-file duplicated heavy admin/profile implementations from `App.js`.
- Removed unused `StatusBadge` symbol in `App.js` after extraction.
- `App.js` reduced from `2478` lines to `1739` lines.

### Backend
- No backend behavior changes in this milestone.

### Database
- No schema changes.

### Docs/Ops
- Added this release note for milestone tracking and policy compliance.

## Breaking changes
- None.

## Environment/config changes
- No environment variable changes.

## Migration and data impact
- No migrations required.
- No data changes.

## Deployment and verification
1. Rebuild stack:
   - `docker compose --env-file .env up -d --build`
2. Confirm health endpoint version is `1.9.20`.
3. Verify key UI surfaces still function (Profile, Members, Integrations, Settings).

## Rollback guidance
- Revert to previous tag/image and redeploy if UI regressions are found.
- No DB rollback required for this milestone.

## Known issues and follow-up
- `App.js` is reduced significantly but still above long-term target; additional extraction work remains before 2.0.
- Continue phased de-bloat to align with engineering modularity policy without introducing high-risk rewrites.
