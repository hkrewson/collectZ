# v2.0.0

## Version and date
- Version: `2.0.0`
- Date: `2026-03-02`

## Milestone target and status
- Target milestone: `2.0.0`
- Status: `Completed`

## Summary
This is the stable 2.0 release for homelab use. It consolidates the RC hardening work, mixed-media library workflows, identifier-first imports, and production-safe security defaults into a documented and validated release.

## What changed
- Finalized multi-user cookie-session auth + CSRF enforcement for primary flows.
- Finalized unified mixed-media library UX for movies, TV, books, audio, games, and comic books.
- Finalized import stack:
  - Plex import,
  - generic CSV import,
  - Delicious CSV import,
  - comics import via Metron integration.
- Finalized identifier-first matching/dedupe behavior (`ISBN`, `EAN/UPC`, `ASIN` where available) with audit visibility.
- Finalized admin operations for integrations, members, activity, and settings in the 2.0 scope.
- Finalized release process artifacts:
  - RC test matrix,
  - go/no-go report,
  - migration rehearsal/init parity evidence.

## Breaking changes
- None from `2.0.0-rc.1`.

## Environment/config changes
- `APP_VERSION` now defaults to canonical metadata when unset.
- Hardcoded compose/runtime build metadata fallbacks were removed.
- Runtime health payload is simplified to version-centric fields.

## Migration and data impact
- No new schema migration between `2.0.0-rc.1` and `2.0.0`.
- Existing 2.0 migration chain remains authoritative and validated via parity/rehearsal checks.

## Deployment and verification
1. Build and start:
   - `docker compose --env-file .env up -d --build`
2. Verify health:
   - `curl -sS http://localhost:3000/api/health`
   - Expect `"version":"2.0.0"`.
3. Verify auth and core CRUD:
   - login/logout,
   - add/edit/delete across media types,
   - run one import workflow and confirm activity entries.
4. Verify release tag in UI sidebar links to this release note.

## Rollback guidance
- Roll back images/tag to `2.0.0-rc.1` if required.
- No immediate rollback migration step is required for this finalization cut.

## Security vulnerability triage
High findings: tracked by dependency triage policy and staged PR workflow; no new 2.0 exceptions introduced.
Owner: @hkrewson
Target remediation milestone: `2.1.0` (dependency cadence + modernization track)
- CI gates remain enforced:
  - gitleaks,
  - dependency scan with triage markers,
  - migration parity/rehearsal,
  - compose smoke,
  - image scan.

## Known issues and follow-up
- Dependency modernization majors (Express 5, Zod 4, React 19, Tailwind 4) remain intentionally deferred.
- Post-2.0 metadata normalization/performance work begins in `2.1.0`.
