# v2.0.0-alpha.6.2

- Date: 2026-02-24
- Version: `2.0.0-alpha.6.2`
- Scope: regression test alignment for scoped access semantics

## Changed

- Updated RBAC regression assertions for non-admin edit/delete of admin-owned media:
  - Accept `403` (permission denied) or `404` (no existence disclosure across scope).

## Why

- With library-scoped isolation enabled, cross-library access can correctly return `404` to avoid leaking entity existence.
