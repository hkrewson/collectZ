## Milestone target and status
- Target: 1.9.24 activity UI simplification follow-up
- Status: Completed

## Summary
Simplified Activity page page-size control to a numeric-only selector and kept the reduced single-search workflow.

## What changed
### Frontend
- Updated `Admin Settings -> Activity` page-size selector to integer-only values:
  - `10`, `25`, `50`, `100`
- Removed label text from selector options (no `Page size:` prefix).
- Kept one search field + paging row structure from `1.9.24-r1`.

### Backend
- No backend changes in this patch.

### Database
- No schema changes.

### Docs/Ops
- Added this patch release note.

## Breaking changes
- None.

## Environment/config changes
- No environment variable changes.

## Migration and data impact
- No migrations required.
- No data changes.

## Deployment and verification
1. Rebuild stack:
   - `docker compose --env-file .env up -d --build`
2. Verify version:
   - `/api/health` returns `1.9.24-r2`
3. In Activity UI:
   - confirm page-size dropdown values are exactly `10`, `25`, `50`, `100`.

## Rollback guidance
- Revert Activity component patch and redeploy prior image if needed.
- No DB rollback required.

## Known issues and follow-up
- Advanced filtering remains API-only by design for now.
