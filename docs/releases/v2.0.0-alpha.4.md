# v2.0.0-alpha.4

- Date: 2026-02-24
- Version: `2.0.0-alpha.4`
- Scope: library selection correctness and view consistency

## Fixed

- `/api/libraries` now resolves `active_library_id` from database user state, preventing stale request-state fallback selection.
- New library creation response includes `active_library_id` and UI immediately applies it.
- Media list switching now guards against stale async responses overriding current-library results.
- Library switch now clears visible media immediately before loading scoped results.

## UX

- Admin library selector shows `LibraryName - OwnerName - count`.
- User selector shows `LibraryName - count`.
- Active library context remains visible in Library and Import views.
