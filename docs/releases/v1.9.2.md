- Status: Completed

## Summary
Strengthened secret handling for integrations and improved startup/config safety checks.

## What changed
### Backend
- Enforced production requirement for `INTEGRATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
- Improved decrypt-failure visibility/remediation signaling.
- Made trust-proxy behavior explicit and configurable.

### Frontend
- Surfaced integration decrypt health metadata for troubleshooting.

### Database
- No major schema changes required.

### Docs/Ops
- Documented encryption key and proxy behavior expectations.

## Breaking changes
- Production startup now fails if `INTEGRATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is not set.

## Environment/config changes
- Required in production: `INTEGRATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

## Migration and data impact
- No destructive schema changes.

## Deployment and verification
1. Ensure `INTEGRATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set.
2. Restart stack.
3. Verify integrations page shows healthy decrypt status.

## Rollback guidance
- Revert image/config to prior version; restore backup if needed.

## Known issues and follow-up
- Key rotation automation remains operational/manual workflow.
