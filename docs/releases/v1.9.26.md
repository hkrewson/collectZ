# v1.9.26

## Version and date
- Version: `1.9.26`
- Date: `2026-02-24`

## Milestone target and status
- Milestone: `1.9.26 — Portable Compose Topology + Security Triage Baseline`
- Status: `Completed`

## Summary
This release removes fixed container naming from compose topology, updates CI checks to use service-resolved container IDs, and establishes explicit baseline security-triage documentation requirements before 2.0.

## What changed
### Frontend
- No frontend behavior changes in this milestone.

### Backend
- Added backend unit test baseline (`backend/scripts/unit-tests.js`) covering:
  - CSV parsing behavior,
  - Plex normalization behavior,
  - scope-context SQL helper behavior.

### Database
- No schema changes.

### Docs/Ops
- Removed `container_name` coupling from compose files to allow parallel stack deployment and safer project-name isolation.
- Updated CI compose health checks to resolve backend/frontend container IDs dynamically (`docker compose ps -q`).
- Added CI policy guard to block reintroduction of `container_name`.
- Added CI execution for backend unit tests (`npm run test:unit`) in the migration-check pipeline.
- Set production registry-compose session cookie default to secure mode.
- Tightened roadmap requirements for `1.9.26`, `1.9.27`, and `1.9.28`, and formalized post-2.0 recommendations.

## Breaking changes
- Compose users must not rely on fixed Docker container names for automation. Use service names via `docker compose` commands instead.

## Environment/config changes
- Registry compose default now uses secure session cookies by default (`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true`).

## Migration and data impact
- None.

## Deployment and verification
1. Pull new images/build locally.
2. Run `docker compose --env-file .env config` and verify no `container_name` entries.
3. Start stack and verify health:
   - `docker compose ps`
   - `curl -s http://localhost:4000/health`
4. Verify CI pipeline passes compose smoke and regression jobs.

## Rollback guidance
- Revert to prior image tag/version (`1.9.25`) and redeploy compose stack.
- No data rollback required.

## Known issues and follow-up
- `frontend/src/App.js` remains above target modularity budget and is explicitly scoped for `1.9.27`.
- Final 2.0 migration rehearsal remains scoped for `1.9.28`.

## Security vulnerability triage
- High findings: present in dependency scan outputs (`npm audit --omit=dev`) for both backend/frontend trees.
- Owner: `@hkrewson` (project maintainer) with engineering implementation support in this repo.
- Target remediation milestone: `1.9.28` (pre-2.0 closure gate for dependency/base-image upgrade pass).
- Exception/compensating control: CI blocks `critical` findings; `high` findings are explicitly tracked here and must be reduced before 2.0 go/no-go signoff.
