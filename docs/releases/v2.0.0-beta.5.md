## Version and date
- Version: `2.0.0-beta.5`
- Date: `2026-02-28`

## Milestone target and status
- Target: `2.0.0-beta.5`
- Status: Completed (signed metadata fields end-to-end)

## Summary
- Added signed collectible metadata fields for all media types.
- Wired fields through DB schema, API validation, create/update SQL paths, CSV import parsing, and library UI forms/details.

## What changed
- DB:
  - Added `media.signed_by`, `media.signed_role`, `media.signed_on`, `media.signed_at`.
  - Added `media_signed_role_check` constraint (`author|producer|cast`).
  - Added migration `v25`.
  - Updated `init.sql` parity and schema_migrations bootstrap list.
- Backend:
  - Added validation support for signed fields.
  - Added signed fields to media create/update/upsert SQL paths.
  - Added signed fields to generic CSV mapping and Delicious normalization mapping.
  - Updated CSV template to include signed columns.
- Frontend:
  - Added signed fields to media form (add/edit).
  - Added signed metadata display to the media detail drawer.
  - Added payload serialization for signed fields.

## Breaking changes
- None.

## Environment/config changes
- None.

## Migration and data impact
- Migration `v25` adds nullable columns to `media`; existing rows remain valid.
- No destructive data transformations.

## Deployment and verification
1. Rebuild/restart services so migration `v25` applies.
2. Verify add/edit media supports:
   - Signed by
   - Signed as (Author/Producer/Cast)
   - Signed on
   - Signed at
3. Verify media detail drawer shows signed values when set.
4. Verify CSV template now includes signed columns.

## Rollback guidance
- Roll back application image/tag to previous version.
- If schema rollback is required, drop added columns and constraint manually for `v25` environments.

## Known issues and follow-up
- No type-specific gating for signed fields; they are intentionally available for all media types.
