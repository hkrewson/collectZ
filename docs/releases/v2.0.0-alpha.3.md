# v2.0.0-alpha.3

- Date: 2026-02-24
- Version: `2.0.0-alpha.3`
- Scope: 2.0 Wave 1 follow-up UX and selection correctness

## Fixed

- New library creation now remains selected server-authoritatively (removed stale local override behavior).
- Library context visibility improved:
  - Sidebar selector labels now include library ID, owner email, and item count.
  - Library page displays active library badge.
  - Import page displays explicit target library.

## Changed

- Library list API now includes `created_by_email` and `created_by_name` metadata for clearer admin selection context.

## UI Verification

1. Create a new library and verify it remains selected immediately.
2. Confirm active library badge shows in Library view.
3. Confirm Import view shows target library name and ID.
4. For admin accounts with duplicate library names, verify selector entries are distinguishable by ID/owner/count.
