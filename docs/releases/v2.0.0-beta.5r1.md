- Status: Completed

## Summary
- Finalized beta.5 follow-up fixes and roadmap clarifications without changing core milestone scope.

## What changed
- Fixed signed-date edit behavior so `signed_on` remains valid in edit mode and saves reliably.
- Updated sidebar ordering for cleaner UX:
  - Library: Audio, Books, Comic Books, Games, Movies, TV.
  - Admin: Activity, Feature Flags, Integrations, Members, Settings.
- Extended roadmap planning:
  - `2.0.0-beta.6` now explicitly includes comic enrichment provider strategy (Metron primary, GCD fallback, ComicVine optional).
  - Added optional valuation milestone `2.7.0` for PriceCharting + eBay integrations.

## Breaking changes
- None.

## Environment/config changes
- None.

## Migration and data impact
- No new DB migration in `beta.5r1`.
- Existing `beta.5` migration (`v25`) remains current.

## Deployment and verification
1. Rebuild frontend/backend images and restart stack.
2. Verify edit flow for signed items:
   - open existing item with `Signed on`, click Edit, save without retyping date.
3. Verify sidebar ordering in desktop/mobile nav.
4. Verify app version displays `2.0.0-beta.5r1`.

## Rollback guidance
- Roll back application image/tag to `2.0.0-beta.5` if needed.
- No schema rollback required for this revision.

## Known issues and follow-up
- Vision cover recognition robustness and signed-proof photo attachments are scoped for `2.0.0-beta.6`.
- Optional pricing integrations are deferred to `2.7.0`.
