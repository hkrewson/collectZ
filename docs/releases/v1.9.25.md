# v1.9.25

## Version and date
- Version: `1.9.25`
- Date: `2026-02-24`

## Milestone target and status
- Target: 1.9.25 pre-2.0 go/no-go automation
- Status: Completed

## Summary
Added tagged-release preflight automation in CI that enforces evidence completeness and publishes a go/no-go report artifact for release decisions.

## What changed
### Frontend
- No frontend behavior changes in this milestone.

### Backend
- No backend runtime/API changes in this milestone.

### Database
- No schema changes.

### Docs/Ops
- CI workflow now triggers on tags (`v*`) in addition to `main`.
- Added `release-preflight` job in CI for tagged runs:
  - downloads required evidence artifacts,
  - fails if evidence files are missing,
  - generates `preflight-go-no-go.md`,
  - uploads `preflight-go-no-go` artifact.
- Added release checklist doc:
  - `docs/wiki/17-Release-Go-No-Go-Checklist.md`
- Updated wiki index and CI/policy docs to reference preflight blockers and exception path.

## Breaking changes
- None.

## Environment/config changes
- No environment variable changes.

## Migration and data impact
- No migrations required.
- No data changes.

## Deployment and verification
1. Rebuild stack:
   - `docker compose --env-file .env up -d --build`
2. Verify version:
   - `/api/health` returns `1.9.25`
3. Push a tag (`v1.9.25`) and confirm CI:
   - runs `release-preflight`,
   - uploads `preflight-go-no-go` artifact.

## Rollback guidance
- Revert workflow/docs changes and re-run pipeline from prior tag if preflight logic needs rollback.
- No DB rollback required.

## Known issues and follow-up
- Preflight artifact is generated for tagged runs only by design.
- Future enhancement: publish preflight markdown directly to release notes body automatically.
