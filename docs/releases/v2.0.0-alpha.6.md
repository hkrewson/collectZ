# v2.0.0-alpha.6

- Date: 2026-02-24
- Version: `2.0.0-alpha.6`
- Scope: admin guardrails + library regression coverage

## Added

- Admin library management actions in Admin section (`Members -> Libraries` tab):
  - Transfer ownership
  - Archive (typed name confirmation)
  - Delete (typed name confirmation)

## Changed

- `DELETE /api/libraries/:id` now requires `confirm_name` in request body.
- New endpoints:
  - `POST /api/libraries/:id/transfer`
  - `POST /api/libraries/:id/archive`
  - `POST /api/libraries/:id/unarchive`
- Audit coverage added for:
  - `library.transfer`
  - `library.archive`
  - `library.unarchive`
  - enriched `library.delete` details

## Tests

- Extended RBAC regression script to cover:
  - library create auto-select
  - scoped library switching behavior
  - non-empty delete block
  - transfer ownership
  - archive/delete of empty libraries
  - scope hint denial for non-admin `library_id`
